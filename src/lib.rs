//! pico1541
//!
//! This implements a USB device that allows Commodore disk drives to be
//! connected to a PC.
//!
//! The device can either emulate an xum1541, and is therefore supported
//! directly by [`OpenCBM`](https://github.com/OpenCBM/OpenCBM), or provides
//! extended capabilities and is detected as a pico1541.

// A note about Statics
//
// We set up statics primarily to avoid lifetime issues, and to allow us to
// spawn tasks (accessing these statics), and to split our code into
// separate modules.
//
// These are a bit tricksy to get right, so here is some general guidance:
//
// - Use StaticCell for statics that cannot be initialized at compile time.
//
// - Use ConstStaticCell for statics that can be initialized at compile time.
//   Note that initialization is different than mutability.  A ConstStaticCell
//   can be mutable, when used with RefCell, but it must be initialized at
//   compile time.  It also cannot be take()n and then modified and then
//   take()n again.
//
// - If your static will be immutable, that is all that is required.
//
// - If your static will be mutable, but you will be passing ownership of it
//   to another object, then no Mutex is required either.
//
// - If you need mutable access, you need to use a Mutex.  If you are using a
//   embassy_sync::mutex::Mutex (which is async) you do not need a RefCell for
//   interior mutability.  If you use a blocking_mutexx::Mutex you do.
//   - Generally use CriticalSectionRawMutex, as these work on multi-core
//     systems.
//   - ThreadModeRawMutex is, as it sounds, so single threaded usage.
//   - NoopRawMutex is for when you don't need a mutex.
//
//   Our implementation is not sufficiently dependent on performance to
//   require optimization here, so we tend to use CriticalSectionRawMutex.
//
// The statics tend to be stored in the module that creates them.  So, for
// example, the GPIO static is in gpio.

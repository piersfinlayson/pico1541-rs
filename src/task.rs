// Threading and tasks model
//
// One the Pico we have 2 cores available - 0 and 1.
//
// Core 0 is the main core, and is where the main() function runs.  We use it
// for all of the non-protocol handling tasks, including
// - the embassy USB stack (which handles the USB protocol and control
//   handling)
// - the display task (which handles the status LED)
// - the watchdog task
//
// In the future, it is expected that core 0 will also gain WiFi and any other
// support.
//
// Core 1 handles bulk USB transfers and all Commodore protocol handling.  This
// is an improvement over the situation on the stock xum1541, which only has a
// single core.  Hence the USB stack itself, control handling and the status
// LED are all handled on the same core as the protocol support.
//
// Tasks can be spawned only on core 0 using the Spawner object pass into
// main().  Core 1 tasks must be spawned via an Eexecutor.  We could use an
// executor to spawn a task on core 0 as well, but you can only spawn a single
// runner that way, which would mean handling scheduling for core 0's tasks.
// Hence we stick with the Spawner for core 0, and use the executor only for
// core 1
//
// Therefore, for consistency between the cores, we spawn tasks on voth cores
// using Executors.  These are stored by non-public statics, and hence can
// only be access via this module, which improved safety.

//
// Statics

// have declared as a static.  We haven't bothered to mutex protect it, so we
// need to use an unsafe block to access it.

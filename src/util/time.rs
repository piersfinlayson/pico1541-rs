//! This file implements custom timing functions and macros used by pico1541
//!
//! In some cases we reimplement embassy-time functions, primarily to make it
//! clear what they are doing under the covers, but in some cases (like
//! delay_ns) because we can't get sub 1us delays with the embassy-time code
//! for Pico.
